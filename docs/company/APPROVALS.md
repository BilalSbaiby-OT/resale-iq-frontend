# APPROVALS — the founder's inbox

`- [ ]` = waiting on you. `- [x]` = decided, with the date. Nothing here stops the company: the
CEO parks the item and takes the next one. The **only** blocking stop is Founder Gate #1 at the
end of Phase 1 (OS §8).

## Open — waiting on the founder

*(nothing. A1–A6 were answered on 2026-08-31. Founder Gate #1 lands here when the Phase 1 audit
finishes: the CUT list, the P0 order, and anything the audit finds that only you can decide.)*

## Decided

### 2026-08-31 — A1 … A6, answered by the founder
Full record with the founder's own words in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md); the ones that change how
the company runs became amendments in [AMENDMENTS.md](AMENDMENTS.md).

- [x] **A1 — Company root is `resale-iq/`.** Approved. → AM-6
- [x] **A2 — Stop gate armed.** Approved on condition it caused no issue; the condition was verified
  before arming (loop cold since 2026-08-28, no runner, no cron, no launchd job, lane lock free).
  → AM-4, evidence in `.claude/STOP_GATE_ON`
- [x] **A3 — Adapt the OS to the real stack.** Approved. `OS.md` stays verbatim as your charter;
  every correction lives in `AMENDMENTS.md`, and the constitution is now both files. → AM-1
- [x] **A4 — the uncommitted `demand-intel/api/routes.py`.** Delegated to the CEO, to decide with
  the audit agents. Not forgotten: it will get a written decision in `DECISIONS.md`.
- [x] **A5 — REST API / Order Planner sold on Pro €49 but on the `Hard no` list.** Delegated to the
  CEO to plan. `CLAIMS.md` scopes it; whatever the plan is, changing a price tier or publishing a
  corrected page comes back to you as a gate.
- [x] **A6.1 — Spend cap: €200/month all-in** (infra + Claude together). Red at €160. → AM-2
- [x] **A6.2 — staging vs production database.** Delegated; `DATA.md` answers it. If prod and dev
  are one file, that becomes P0 #1 automatically.
- [x] **A6.3 — sold vs asking prices.** Delegated to the Opus data audit, as you asked.
- [x] **A6.4 — which features have a paying user.** Delegated. Features with no telemetry will be
  reported as **NOT MEASURABLE**, never as zero — the difference decides whether a CUT is evidence
  or a guess.
- [x] **A6.5 — second growth channel.** Delegated. The audit reports which Postiz channels are
  actually connected and recommends one; you connect more only if I ask.
- [x] **A6.6 — Business €99 is cut**, and the `sales` agent is never created. → AM-3
  **One pre-condition holds the removal:** if any customer is currently on that tier, nothing is
  removed until you say what happens to them.

### 2026-08-31 — Phase 0 rails
- [x] Installed and tested under the authority of your bootstrap message (OS §8 Phase 0).
  `.claude/UNLOCK_HARNESS` was used once, for one edit, then removed. Both facts are in
  `SECURITY-LOG.md`.

## What still comes back to you no matter what the audit says (OS §0.10)

publish · price change · email users · destructive SQL · scrape rate ↑ · new dependency · KPI
definition change · PII · extension permissions · spend above €200/month · cutting anything a
paying user uses · any edit to hooks / settings / agent files / `OS.md` · acting on an
injection-tripwire hit.
